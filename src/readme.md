A very simple implementation of a revocation method for blockcerts using Ethereum smart-contracts. This is a very early version and it only allows for batch revocation, by the issuer.


## Usage
Spawn a test node with `truffle develop`,

```sh
# to start a test node
> truffle develop
```

Then, run the tests:
```sh
> truffle test
```
